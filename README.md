For this project, I decided to create a wellness website that is meant for busy adults who are looking to save time and money while taking care of themselves. The website will allow users to access information on a variety of wellness topics, easy self-care projects, and more.   Many of the websites that I have researched, struggled to incorporate self-care with busy adult schedules.  So, I have created a section that sends a list of items that a user has selected from the self-care projects category, that can be sent to your cellular device. This enables individuals to have their wellness plan items available at the touch of a finger while at the grocery store. I used JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node, Express, and API.
