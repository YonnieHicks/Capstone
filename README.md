For my capstone project, I decided to create a website called The Unstressed Mom that is meant for busy moms who can benefit from some of the activities that Iâ€™ve discovered that help me unwind and destress. The future states of this website will allow users to access information on a wide variety of fun and informative topics. I used JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node, Express, and two APIs.

Name: The Unstressed Mom
